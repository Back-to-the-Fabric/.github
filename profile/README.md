# Welcome 

Welcome to the **Back to the Fabric** project!

![Back to the Fabric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Back-to-the-Fabric/.github/main/pictures/bttf.png "Project logo")

We do ports, we do backports, we do back to (the) Fabric ports!

And we do love puns.

_(yes, it is all Minecraft mods)_

# About us

This project was launched by [Nerjal Nosk](https://github.com/NerjalNosk) at the end of 2022, and aims to bring a bunch of Minecraft mods to [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) from other modloaders, or just update them from old Minecraft versions.

As of today, we are a total of <n>1</n> person, and ready to welcome new members who would be motivated on participating in the project.
<!-- Yes I used a non-existant HTML tag to distinguish the number. So what? At least it'll be easier to find out when updating -->

## Our members

As of today, our team regroups a total of <n>1</n> person, and aims to grow bigger, to provide always more mod ports to the community.
